But we prefer getting on the call once the outlined steps are completed . 

A beautiful woman may or may not be charming, but a charming woman is by default beautiful.
Beauty can be inherited, but charm cannot.
Beauty is skin deep, charm is much more than a superficial layer.
Beauty fades, charm stays on.
Beauty is the way you look and dress. Charm is the way you talk, the grace with which you walk, the way you respond to situations, the pitch of your voice, your choice of words, your tone, your smile, the way you laugh and so on. Charm is an attitude one carries.


Letâ€™s face it. Everyone has problems. It might be something as small as a minor exam the next day or as huge as the loss of a loved one. These problems and losses define who we are. But then, the human mind is a wonderful thing. When prompted correctly, it can override these sad, depressing, tensed thoughts and make us escape from them.
